# Data Extraction from 'Open Weather map' API and Storage into BIGQUERY

## Project Overview :
This project consists of extracting weather datas of specific cities upon API calls. The extracted data must be then stored within a file before being loaded in a Database. 

Here I am going to extract data from Netherlands weather stations with [OPEN WEATHER MAP](https://openweathermap.org/api) data files. After extraction, I will structure the data (csv format) with Apache Airflow task orchestration with PythonOperator and BashOperator, then the data will be stored in in a Google Cloud Storage Bucket before loading it to Bigquery.

### Hereafter the steps that i will follow :

1 - GCP Project Creation : 
First of all, i created a new GCP project and enabled BigQuery and API Gateway APIS.

2 - Static Ressources Creation via Terraform : 
To make it more interesting, i decided to create all the static ressources (GCS buckets, roles, service accounts and Datasets) using Terraform. Please find below the link to my Terraform repo :

3 - Orchestrator Deployment : 
I will display two ways to Deploy an Airflow Orchestrator using both CLI (Cloud Console) and the UI.

4 - Dag Creation :
Once all the infrastracture is set, I will proceed with the DAG Creation that will perfom the extraction job.

5 - Testing : 
Finally, i will perform some tests a provide proof of the concept.




## I - GCP Project Creation
To create a Google Cloud project:

1- In the Google Cloud console, go to Menu menu > IAM & Admin > Create a Project.
Go to Create a Project

2 - In the Project Name field, enter a descriptive name for your project.
3 - In the Location field, click Browse to display potential locations for your project. Then, click Select.
4 - Click Create.

Now, Our Google Cloud Project is set and ready for ressources deployment.




## II - Static Ressources Creation via Terraform

First of all, I will start by manually creating a Service Account with Editor role for Terraform to be able to create Ressources on our GCP project.

The following step is to Enable all services APIS that will be used in our project :

The 'Terraform apply' went smoothly, and 9 Ressources Ã  planned for deployment.

Then the next step is to 'Terraform apply' the static ressource created in the other repository.

## III - Airflow Orchestrator Deployment : 

#### Airflow environment creation via gcloud CLI :

To keep it simple, I will create an Airflow env with a basic setup.
To do so, i run the following command in the cloud shell :

`gcloud composer environments create ar-composer-environment \
      --location europe-west1 \
      --image-version composer-2.0.29-airflow-2.2.5`



#### Airflow environment creation via UI :

In Composer service, select **CREATE ENVIRONMENT** > **Composer 2**
